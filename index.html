        <h3>AgeCalcu Age Calculator - Understanding Month and Day Calculations for Accurate Age Calculation</h3>
        <p>
          Calculating someone's age can be confusing, especially when trying to determine the number of months and days between two dates. This is particularly tricky when the starting date is at the end of a month. For example, we might count the time from Feb. 20 to March 20 as one month, but when it comes to calculating the age between Feb. 28, 2015, and Mar. 31, 2015, there are two ways to do it. If we count Feb. 28 to Mar. 28 as one month, the result would be one month and three days. However, if we consider both Feb. 28 and Mar. 31 as the end of the month, then the result is one month. There are similar situations for dates like Apr. 30 to May 31, May 30 to June 30, and so on. At AgeCalcu, we understand how confusing these inconsistencies can be. That's why we use the latest and most up-to-date methods for calculating age. This ensures that our results are as accurate as possible, regardless of the starting and ending dates.
